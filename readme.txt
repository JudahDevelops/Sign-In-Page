#Sign In Page#
This is my first project since I started re-learning how to code, It's just a sign in page I made with a design I thought up from my notebook. 
It doesn't do anything it's just the design aesthetic I wanted to work on, not only did I practice the skills I learned from the lessons I have been taking but I ended up remembering a lot of the other css properties I knew back in the day, It was an amazing learning experience.
The code explanation can be found in very long paragraph comments all over my css code and as for the html theres not much to try and understand so I did not add any comments.
